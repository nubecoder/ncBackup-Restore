Project info:

  Selective and configurable backup and restore for android.

Features include:

  Recovery based backup and restore to minimise conflicts.
  Outputs progress and info to the recovery UI.
  Should support most devices with a custom recovery.
    Tested on a Samsung Epic 4G (ClockworkMod Recovery) and a HTC Evo 4G (AmonRA recovery).
  Backups are tar based, gzip compressed and configurable.
  Fully configurable via files on the sdcard (/sdcard/backup-restore/).
    The include file includes files and folders (/sdcard/backup-restore/include).
    The exclude file excludes files and folders (/sdcard/backup-restore/exclude).
    The name file determines the name of the backup, e.g. "backup" will create "backup.tar.gz" ("backup" is the default).
  Pre-configured to backup boot animations, ringtones, notifications, and alarms.
  Pre-configured to not backup useless items such as logs, tombstones, etc (will create default include and exclude files on the sdcard).
  Does not wipe data partition before restoring (unless you choose the "ncRestore_Data_Wipe.zip").
  Should preserve apps moved to the sdcard.

Zips that can be installed via a custom recovery can be found here:
